    <h1>About Me – Chinedu Ogbonna</h1>
    <p>I believe media storytelling captures moments in ways words alone cannot. So allow me to tell my story — one medium at a time.</p>
    <h2>Rock Bottom: The Beginning of My Rebuild</h2>

    <p>The picture above captures the lowest point in my life.</p>
    <span>I had just dropped out of engineering school. I lost my job. I lost my apartment.</span>
    <span>And on the eve of my Google Africa Developer Scholarship exam — the one I had prepared for months — I was robbed. My laptop and phone? Gone.</span>
    <p>At that moment, I had nothing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No job.</li>
        <li>No phone.</li>
        <li>No accomdation of my own</li>
        <li>Nothing to my name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But rock bottom has a strange power — it forces you to choose: stay down or rise up. And from that moment… Stiil I rise.</p>
    <h2>Still I rise</h2>

    <p>I’m not trying to sound like a motivational speaker—really, I’m not. And this isn’t one of those “I beat the odds” kind of stories either. But the truth is, despite the setbacks, I chose to keep going.</p>
    <p>After everything, I locked in and taught myself digital marketing. I helped companies grow their portfolios and scaled user acquisition. Then I made a bold move—into product marketing. Guess what? I thrived. I’m still thriving. My income surpassed my expectations, and for the first time in a long time, I was genuinely loving the work.</p>
    <p>Then, on a random Sunday, I got an email. DevCareer X Bybit. A scholarship. Shared by Hck Sultan. And just like that, the old spark returned. The curiosity. The desire. I watched a few videos. I felt it again. And I applied—this time, to pivot into Cloud.</p>
    <p>Will it be tough balancing this with two jobs? Absolutely. But what is life without learning?</p>

    </video>
    <p>I am done sha, I am just trying to add video to it and yeah, I happened to see a recent video of my babe and my niece chilling in the new apartment we were able to rent for my parent.</p>
    <p> This is the template of success for me and I hope to scale it.</p>
